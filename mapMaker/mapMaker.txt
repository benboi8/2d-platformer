load image using pillow
create a temp image to edit


for each pixel in the image:
	check if height of image - current pixel height is less than the biggest rect height and do the same for width
		break from loop

	go down until non-black color
	once non-black color is found go to the original pixel height and go right one pixel if it is black
	
	once down and right are both white pixels 
		get the smallest height value to use as the rect height
		get the width of the rect
		create an obj to store this rect

	get progress of program
		(image width * image height) - (pixel x * pixel y)
